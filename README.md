Here is a repo for a laser frequency noise simulator. The theory is based on Keller, Ultrafast Lasers.

To run the simulator using voila and binder click this link -> [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Adem-O/LaserNoiseSim/HEAD?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2FNoise-V4.ipynb)

Or use this URL: [https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Adem-O/LaserNoiseSim/HEAD?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2FNoise-V4.ipynb](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Adem-O/LaserNoiseSim/HEAD?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2FNoise-V4.ipynb

**NOTE:** Binder takes a considerable amount of time to load, however it should _eventually_ load. 


**Once it loads you may face a green loading wheel which is displays 'running' for a long time. If it fails to load try refreshing the tab and wait a miniute and the webpage should load.**
